\maketitle

\noindent This document serves as my playground for practising the art of
writing mathematical proofs. As such, do not expect to find a proof of the
Riemann hypothesis here, or indeed anything else that is original. Instead, you
will find a range of proofs related to mostly standard undergraduate material
that I \textit{hope} are correct.

\section*{Algebra}

\begin{theorem}[Quadratic Formula]
  The solutions of the quadratic equation of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) are
  \[ x = \frac{-b ±\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}. \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(ax^{2} + bx + c = 0\). Complete the square to obtain
  \begin{equation*}
    {\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)}^2 = \frac{b^{2}}{4a^{2}} - \frac{c}{a}.
  \end{equation*}
  Solve for \(x\) to obtain
  \begin{equation*}
    x = -\frac{b}{2a} ±\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
  \end{equation*}
  Thus,
  \begin{equation*}
    x = \frac{-b ± \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
  \end{equation*}
  as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Logarithm of a Product]
  \(\displaystyle \log_{b}(xy) = \log_{b}(x) + \log_{b}(y)\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(x ≔ b^m\) and \(y ≔ b^n\). From the definition of a logarithm, it
  follows that \(\log_b(x) = m\) and \(\log_b(y) = n\).

  By substituting \(b^m\) and \(b^n\) for \(x\) and \(y\) in \(\log_b(xy)\),
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \log_b(xy) &= \log_b(b^{m}b^{n}) \\
               &= \log_b(b^{m + n}) \\
               &= m + n.
  \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  Since \(m = \log_b(x)\) and \(n = \log_b(y)\), the above can be written as
  \begin{equation*}
    \log_b(xy) = \log_b(x) + \log_b(y),
  \end{equation*}
  which is the desired identity.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Logarithm of a Quotient]
  \(\displaystyle \log_{b}\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \log_{b}(x) -
  \log_{b}(y)\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(x ≔ b^m\) and \(y ≔ b^n\). From the definition of a logarithm, it
  follows that \(\log_b(x) = m\) and \(\log_b(y) = n\).

  By substituting \(b^m\) and \(b^n\) for \(x\) and \(y\) in \(\log_b(x/y)\),
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \log_b\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) &= \log_b\left(\frac{b^m}{b^n}\right) \\
                                   &= \log_b(b^{m - n}) \\
                                   &= m - n.
  \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  Since \(m = \log_b(x)\) and \(n = \log_b(y)\), the above can be written as
  \begin{equation*}
    \log_b\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \log_{b}(x) - \log_{b}(y),
  \end{equation*}
  which is the desired identity.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Logarithm of a Power]
  \(\displaystyle \log_{b}(x^y) = y\log_{b}(x)\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(x ≔ b^n\). From the definition of a logarithm, it
  follows that \(\log_b(x) = n\).

  By substituting \(b^n\) for \(x\) in \(\log_b(x^y)\),
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \log_b(x^y) &= \log_b({(b^n)}^y) \\
                &= \log_b(b^{yn}) \\
                &= yn.
  \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  Since \(n = \log_b(x)\), the above can be written as
  \begin{equation*}
    \log_b(x^y) = y\log_b(x),
  \end{equation*}
  which is the desired identity.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Change of Base Formula]
  Any logarithm can be rewritten in terms of another base with the formula
  \[ \log_{b}(a) = \frac{\log_{x}(a)}{\log_{x}(b)}. \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(c ≔ \log_b(a)\). From the definition of a logarithm, it follows
  that \(b^c = a\). By taking the base-\(x\) logarithm of both sides,
  \begin{equation*}
      \log_x(b^c) = \log_x(a).
  \end{equation*}
  Therefore,
  \begin{align*}
      c\log_x(b) &= \log_x(a) \\
               c &= \frac{\log_x(a)}{\log_x(b)}.
  \end{align*}
  Since \(c = \log_b(a)\), the above can be written as
  \begin{equation*}
    \log_b(a) = \frac{\log_x(a)}{\log_x(b)},
  \end{equation*}
  which is the change of base formula.
\end{proof}

\section*{Number Theory}

\begin{definition}[Natural Number]
  A natural number is a member of the set \(ℕ = ℤ^{+} = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}\).
\end{definition}

\begin{result}
  The number \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose that \(\sqrt{2}\) is rational, and so it can be expressed as a ratio
  of two integers. Hence, let \(\sqrt{2} = a/b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are
  coprime. By squaring both sides,
  \begin{equation*}
    2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2} ⟺ 2b^2 = a^2.
  \end{equation*}
  Therefore, \(a^2\) is even, and in turn, \(a\) is also even, since squares of
  odd integers are never even. Hence, there exists some integer \(k\) such that
  \(a = 2k\). By substituting this in,
  \begin{equation*}
    2b^2 = {(2k)}^2 ⟺ b^2 = 2k^2.
  \end{equation*}
  Using the same reasoning as with \(a\), it must be that \(b\) is also even.
  However, since \(a\) and \(b\) are both even, a contradiction arises. Two
  even integers cannot be coprime, so \(\sqrt{2}\) cannot be expressed as a
  ratio of two integers. Thus, \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  There are infinitely many prime numbers.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose there are only finitely many prime numbers. Let \(p_1, p_2, \ldots,
  p_n\) be a list of all primes and let \(m ≔ p_{1}p_{2} \cdots p_n + 1\). Note
  that \(m\) is not divisible by \(p_1\) since dividing \(m\) by \(p_1\) gives
  a remainder of \(1\). Similarly, \(m\) is not divisible by any other number
  in the list. Because \(m\) is larger than \(1\), \(m\) is either a prime or a
  product of primes.

  If \(m\) is a prime, then we have found a prime not in our list, which
  contradicts the assumption that it was a list of all prime numbers.

  If \(m\) is a product of primes, then it must be divisible by one of the
  primes in our list. However, we have shown \(m\) is not divisible by any
  number in the list. Thus the assumption that the list was a list of all prime
  numbers is again contradicted.

  Since the assumption that there are only finitely many prime numbers has led
  to a contradiction, there must be infinitely many prime numbers.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  The sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers is equal to
  \[ \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}. \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We proceed by induction. If \(n = 1\), then the theorem is clearly true:
  \begin{equation*}
    ∑_{i = 1}^1 i = \frac{1(1 + 1)}{2} = 1.
  \end{equation*}
  So, the theorem holds for the base case of \(n = 1\).

  For the inductive hypothesis, assume the formula is true for all \(k > 1\).
  Hence,
  \begin{equation*}
    ∑_{i = 1}^k i = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2}.
  \end{equation*}

  For the inductive step, let \(n = k + 1\). By the properties of summation,
  \begin{equation*}
    ∑_{i = 1}^{k + 1} i = \sum_{i = 1}^{k} i + (k + 1).
  \end{equation*}
  By using the inductive hypothesis,
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    ∑_{i = 1}^{k} i + (k + 1) &= \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} + (k + 1) \\
                              &= \frac{k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1)}{2} \\
                              &= \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2} \\
                              &= \frac{(k + 1)((k + 1) + 1)}{2}.
  \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  So, the theorem holds when \(n = k + 1\).

  Since the base case and inductive step have been shown, the theorem holds for
  all natural numbers by the principle of mathematical induction.
\end{proof}

\section*{Set Theory}

\begin{definition}[Ordered Pair]\label{def:ordered_pair}
  The ordered pair of two elements \(a\) and \(b\) is the set
  \[ (a, b) ≔ \{\{a\}, \{a, b\}\}. \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Cartesian Product]\label{def:cartesian_product}
  The Cartesian product of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) is the set
  \[ A × B ≔ \{\, (a, b) : a ∈ A, b ∈ B \,\}. \]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  For any sets \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), the following hold:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \((A ∪ B) × C = (A × C) ∪ (B × C)\)
    \item \((A ∩ B) × C = (A × C) ∩ (B × C)\)
    \item \(A × (B ∪ C) = (A × B) ∪ (A × C)\)
    \item \(A × (B ∩ C) = (A × B) ∩ (A × C)\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof of A]
  Let \((u, v) ∈ (A ∪ B) × C\). Therefore, \(u ∈ A ∪ B\) and \(v ∈ C\). This
  means that \(u ∈ A\) or \(u ∈ B\). If \(u ∈ A\), then \((u, v) ∈ A × C\). If
  \(u ∈ B\), then \((u, v) ∈ B × C\). Either way, \((u, v) ∈ (A × C) ∪ (B ×
  C)\). Hence,
  \begin{equation*}
    (A ∪ B) × C ⊆ (A × C) ∪ (B × C).
  \end{equation*}

  Now, let \(z ≔ (x, y) ∈ (A × C) ∪ (B × C)\). Either \(z ∈ A × C\) or \(z ∈ B
  × C\). In the first case, \(x ∈ A\) and \(y ∈ C\). In the second, \(x ∈ B\)
  and \(y ∈ C\), so \(z = (x, y) ∈ (A ∪ B) × C\). This implies that
  \begin{equation*}
    (A × C) ∪ (B × C) ⊆ (A ∪ B) × C.
  \end{equation*}

  Putting the two parts together completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of B]
  Let \((u, v) ∈ (A ∩ B) × C\). Therefore, \(u ∈ A ∩ B\) and \(v ∈ C\). This
  means that \(u ∈ A\) and \(u ∈ B\). Thus, \((u, v) ∈ A × C\) and \((u, v) ∈ B
  × C\), and consequently, \((u, v) ∈ (A × C) ∩ (B × C)\). Hence,
  \begin{equation*}
    (A ∩ B) × C ⊆ (A × C) ∩ (B × C).
  \end{equation*}

  Now, let \(z ≔ (x, y) ∈ (A × C) ∩ (B × C)\).  Therefore, \(z ∈ A × C\) and
  \(z ∈ B × C\). So, \(x ∈ A\) and \(x ∈ B\), and likewise, \(y ∈ C\). Thus,
  \(z = (x, y) ∈ (A ∩ B) × C\). This implies that
  \begin{equation*}
       (A × C) ∩ (B × C) ⊆ (A ∩ B) × C.
  \end{equation*}

  Putting the two parts together completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\section*{Real Analysis}

\begin{definition}[Limit]
  Let \(f\) be a real-valued function defined on a subset \(D\) of the real
  numbers. Let \(c\) be a limit point of \(D\) and let \(L\) be a real number.
  We say that \[ \lim_{x → c} f(x) = L \] if for every \(ε > 0\), there exists
  a \(δ > 0\) such that, for all \(x ∈ D\), \[ 0 < \abs{x - c} < δ ⟹ \abs{f(x)
  - L} < ε. \]
\end{definition}

\begin{result}
  \(\displaystyle \lim_{x → 2} (x^{2} + 1) = 5.\)
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose \(ε > 0\). Let \(δ ≔ \min(1, ε/5)\) and \(x ∈ ℝ\) such that
  \(0 < \abs{x - 2} < δ\).

  Since \(\abs{x - 2} < δ\), it follows that
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \abs{x - 2} < 1 &⟹ -1 < x - 2 < 1 \\
                    &⟹ 1 < x < 3.
  \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  In particular, this means that \(\abs{x + 2} < 5\). Likewise, it follows
  that \(\abs{x - 2} < ε/5\).

  Hence,
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \abs{x - 2} < δ &⟹ \abs{x - 2} < \frac{ε}{5} \\
                    &⟹ \abs{x + 2} \abs{x - 2} < 5 ⋅ \frac{ε}{5} \\
                    &⟹ \abs{x^{2} - 4} < ε \\
                    &⟹ \abs{(x^{2} + 1) - 5} < ε. \qedhere
  \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\begin{result}
  \(\displaystyle \lim_{x → 3} (x^{2} + 6) = 15\).
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose \(ε > 0\). Let \(δ ≔ \min(1, ε/7)\) and \(x ∈ ℝ\) such that
  \(0 < \abs{x - 3} < δ\).

  Since \(\abs{x - 3} < δ\), it follows that
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \abs{x - 3} < 1 &⟹ -1 < x - 3 < 1 \\
                    &⟹ 2 < x < 4.
  \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  In particular, this means that \(\abs{x + 3} < 7\). Likewise, it follows
  that \(\abs{x - 3} < ε/7\).

  Hence,
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \abs{x - 3} < δ &⟹ \abs{x - 3} < \frac{ε}{7} \\
                    &⟹ \abs{x + 3} \abs{x - 3} < 7 ⋅ \frac{ε}{7} \\
                    &⟹ \abs{x^{2} - 9} < ε \\
                    &⟹ \abs{(x^{2} + 6) - 15} < ε. \qedhere
  \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\begin{result}
  \(\displaystyle \lim_{x → 0} \frac{x}{x^{2} + 1} = 0\).
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose \(ε > 0\). Let \(δ ≔ \min(1, 2ε)\) and \(x ∈ ℝ\) such that
  \(0 < \abs{x} < δ\).

  Since \(\abs{x} < δ\), it follows that \(\abs{x} < 1\), and thus
  \(\abs{x^{2} + 1} < 2\). Likewise, it follows that \(\abs{x} < 2ε\).

  Hence,
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \abs{x} < 2ε &⟹ \frac{\abs{x}}{\abs{x^{2} + 1}} < \frac{2ε}{2} \\
                 &⟹ \frac{\abs{x}}{\abs{x^{2} + 1}} < ε \\
                 &⟹ \abs*{\frac{x}{x^{2} + 1}} < ε. \qedhere
  \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\begin{result}
  \(\displaystyle \lim_{x → 5^{+}} \frac{1}{x - 5} = ∞\).
\end{result}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose \(M > 0\). Let \(δ ≔ 1/M\) and \(x ∈ ℝ\) such that
  \(0 < x - 5 < δ\).

  Since \(x - 5 < δ\), it follows that
  \begin{equation*}
    x - 5 < \frac{1}{M} ⟹ \frac{1}{x - 5} > M. \qedhere
  \end{equation*}
\end{proof}

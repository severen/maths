\section{About This Document}

This document contains various assorted proofs that I have written down in order
to assist my understanding. Nothing in here is novel or new, these are all
simply retellings of that which has already been proven.

\section{The Quadratic Formula}

\begin{theorem}
  The solutions of a quadratic equation of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) can be
  found with the formula

  \[ x = \frac{-b ±\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \]

  where \(a ≠ 0\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Completing the square on the general quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\)
  gives

  \begin{align*}
    ax^2 + bx + c &= 0 \\
    ax^2 + bx &= -c \\
    x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x &= -\frac{c}{a} \\
    x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{b^2}{4a^2} &= \frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{c}{a} \\
    {(x + \frac{b}{2a})}^2 &= \frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{c}{a}.
  \end{align*}

  This allows for isolating \(x\), giving

  \begin{align*}
    {(x + \frac{b}{2a})}^2 &= \frac{b^2}{2a^2} - \frac{c}{a} \\
    {(x + \frac{b}{2a})}^2 &= \frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{4ac}{4a^2} \\
    {(x + \frac{b}{2a})}^2 &= \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2} \\
    x + \frac{b}{2a} &= ±\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\
    x &= -\frac{b}{2a} ±\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\
    x &= \frac{-b ± \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
  \end{align*}

  which is the quadratic formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Irrationality of \(\sqrt{2}\)}

\begin{theorem}
  The square root of two, \(\sqrt{2}\), can not be represented as a ratio of two
  integers, and therefore is irrational.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose that \(\sqrt{2}\) is rational and thus can be written as the ratio of
  two integers \(\frac{a}{b}\), where \(a\) is prime to \(b\) (\(a ⟂
  b\)). Therefore, we can state that

  \begin{align*}
    \sqrt{2} &= \frac{a}{b} \\
    2 &= \frac{a^2}{b^2}.
  \end{align*}

  Rearranging for \(a^2\) gives the equation

  \begin{equation*}
    a^2 = 2b^2,
  \end{equation*}

  which shows that \(a^2\) is even, since \(2b^2\) is necessarily even because
  it is a multiple of 2.

  It follows that \(a\) must also be even, as squares of odd integers are never
  even. Therefore, there exists some integer \(k\) that satisfies the equation
  \(a = 2k\).

  Substituting \(2k\) for \(a\) leads to

  \begin{align*}
    {(2k)}^2 &= 2b^2 \\
    4k^2 &= 2b^2 \\
    2k^2 &= b^2,
  \end{align*}

  which demonstrates that \(b^2\) and therefore \(b\) itself must be even, using
  the same reasoning as with \(a^2\).

  Since \(a\) and \(b\) are both even, the assumption that \(\sqrt{2}\) is
  rational and \(a\) is prime to \(b\) no longer holds, as they share a common
  factor of 2.
\end{proof}

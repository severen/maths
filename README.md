# Mathematics Notes and Proofs

This repository contains various references and proofs I have made to assist
with learning mathematics. Essentially, I want to make sure that I fully
understand what I have learnt by making a reference for every topic, as well as
the occasional proof. This additionally makes it harder to forget things, which
is a plus.

The mathematics in this repository should mostly (if not only) consist of
topics typically covered in secondary school and undergraduate university
courses.

## Compiling

Every document in this repository is written in LaTeX. To generate PDFs for
each document, you can run `make` in each subdirectory, provided that you have
a recent version of TeX Live and latexmk installed.

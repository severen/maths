# Mathematics!

This repository contains various mathematical documents and notes that I have
written, such as random proofs and solutions to problems/exercises in books.

The mathematics in this repository mostly consists, so far, of topics typically
covered in undergraduate university courses.

## Compiling

Every document in this repository is written in LaTeX. To generate PDFs for
each document, you can run `make` in each subdirectory, provided that you have
a recent version of TeX Live and latexmk installed.
